# foto

A command-line tool to copy and paste images from a variety of formats to and from the system clipboard.

## Usage
To copy an image to the clipboard:
```bash
foto copy ~/File/Path/To/Image.png
```
To paste an image from the clipboard:
```bash
foto paste ~/New/File/Path/Image.png
```
Although `png` is used in the example, its been tested with other formats including `tiff`, `jpg`, and `svg`. If any issues arise with other formats, open an issue outlining the format used and whether it was copy or pasted.

## Installation
Using homebrew:

```bash
brew install foto
```
